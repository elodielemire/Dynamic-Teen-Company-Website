                    <h3> Programs</h3>
                    <br>Two major programs has helped DTC reduced street children in Cavite City and is continuously being replicated in other parts of the country
                     to aid every community’s efforts in decreasing the number of out-of-school and dropout children thus decreasing the number of children in the
                     streets. The programs are called Kariton Klasrum (Pushcart Classroom) and Learner’s Educational Aid Program (L.E.A.P.). The third major program
                     develops former street children to becoming productive citizens of the community through tertiary education and volunteerism, it is called 
                    Support for Tertiary Education Program (S.T.E.P.). The fourth program called Formal Admission to Career Employment (F.A.C.E.) completes the 
                    phases wherein empowered youth are being referred to companies and potential employers for them to become sustainable and able to provide for
                     themselves and the needs of their family.
